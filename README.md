# At_The_Club
ATC explores some methods of interaction with a human avatar in Unity.

The main focus of this project is human-avatar dialogue. The player can move around freely and interact with objects in a virtual club scene. When approaching an avatar, the virtual human turns to the player and focusses on the player's face. 

A dialogue appears and the player can choose from different options. The avatar will answer according to a predefined logic. Simultaneously, a prerecorded audio file of the speech will be played and the avatar will show a speech animation.

The player can stop the interaction any time by just going away. The conversation will resume when the player moves close to the avatar again.
